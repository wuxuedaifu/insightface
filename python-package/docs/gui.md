# InsightFace Evaluation Studio GUI

InsightFace Evaluation Studio is a local desktop GUI for InsightFace 1.0. It is
designed for no-code face recognition testing, local People Library management,
album organization, enterprise model evaluation, report export, and basic face
swap trials.

## Install

```bash
cd python-package
pip install -e ".[gui]"
insightface-gui
```

PyPI users can install:

```bash
pip install "insightface[gui]"
insightface-gui
```

Aliases:

```bash
insightface-eval-studio
insightface-desktop
python -m insightface.gui
```

## Workspace

By default, user data is stored in:

```text
~/.insightface/gui
```

The workspace contains the SQLite database, crops, exports, reports, and logs.
The GUI does not upload images, videos, embeddings, or reports automatically.

You can override the workspace:

```bash
insightface-gui --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

## File, Folder, and Video Inputs

Image and video pages use the preview frame as the upload target. Click the
empty preview frame labeled `Click to upload or drag a file here`, or drag a
local file onto it. The preview changes color on hover to indicate it is
clickable, and changes again while a valid file is dragged over it. After a file
is loaded, the small `×` button removes it, and dragging another file onto the
preview replaces it.

Multi-file imports, folder imports, CSV files, and local model inputs use
clickable drag-and-drop selectors with hover and drag-over color feedback.

## Mode-based navigation

InsightFace Evaluation Studio uses four workflow modes. The mode selector is in
the top app bar. Face Recognition, Album Management, and Face Swap use a single
full-width workspace, while modes with several workflows show a compact left
sidebar:

1. **Face Recognition**: one Query & Gallery workspace. One gallery image runs
   1:1 compare; multiple gallery images or a folder run 1:N gallery search.
2. **Album Management**: one **Album** workspace for local folder import,
   refresh, DBSCAN face clustering, and photo review.
3. **Face Swap**: one Source + Target = Result workspace. Target can be an
   image or video.
4. **Enterprise Evaluation**: local business evaluation, dataset setup,
   threshold calibration, reports, and commercial next steps.

Global utilities are always available from the top app bar:

- **Settings** opens the application settings dialog for the UI theme. Workspace
  paths are chosen on first launch and are not changed from this dialog.
- **Models** opens runtime settings, model downloads, and custom model directory
  tools.
- **License** opens the License Center dialog.

Settings, Model Settings, Model Downloads, and License Center are intentionally
not shown in the left sidebar.

## Models

Open **Models** from the top app bar or **Tools > Models** to choose:

- model pack: `buffalo_l`, `buffalo_s`, `antelopev2`, or a custom model folder
- provider: Auto, CPU, CUDA when `CUDAExecutionProvider` is available
- detection size: Auto, 128x128, 320x320, 640x640, 1024x1024
- recognition threshold
- batch worker count
- video frame interval

**Auto** detection size is the default. It runs joint 128x128 and 640x640
detection and merges duplicate boxes.

The Runtime tab also lets you choose a face swap model. Only downloaded local
swap models are listed. Download `inswapper_128.onnx` or another compatible
swap model from **Models > Downloads** first.

The GUI opens even when a model is missing. In that case, pages show
`Model is not loaded. Please open Models.`

The GUI does not download models automatically. Open **Models > Downloads** and
click **Refresh Download URLs** to fetch the latest release assets from:

```text
https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/releases
```

The refreshed URLs are cached in:

```text
~/.insightface/gui/cache/model_download_urls.json
```

Downloaded archives are cached in:

```text
~/.insightface/gui/cache/models
```

Zip model packages are extracted to:

```text
~/.insightface/models/<model_name>/
```

For example:

```text
~/.insightface/models/buffalo_l/
~/.insightface/models/antelopev2/
```

Users can also manually place model directories under `~/.insightface/models/`
or configure a custom model directory in **Models > Custom Model Directory**.

## Face Recognition

Open **Face Recognition** and use the full-width **Query & Gallery** workspace.
The Query preview accepts one image by click or drag. The Gallery panel accepts
one image, multiple images, or a folder by click or drag. There is no separate
Choose button in Gallery; click the Gallery panel or drag files/folders onto it.

If Gallery contains one image, **Run Recognition** automatically runs 1:1
compare and reports similarity, threshold, decision, and detection score. If
Gallery contains multiple images or a folder, the same button runs 1:N gallery
search and ranks the gallery images by similarity.

## Multi-face Photo Recognition

Open **Multi-face Photo Recognition** to detect all faces in a group photo,
identify them against People Library, save results to the local database, and
export annotated images or CSV/JSON.

## Batch Processing

Open **Batch Folder Processing**, select an image folder, and choose recursive
scan, crop saving, and identification options. Batch results can be exported to
CSV and JSON.

## Album People Clustering

Open **Album Management > Album** to add one or more album directories. Click
**Import / Refresh** to scan new image files, detect faces, save local crops,
and cluster all indexed faces from the selected directories. The page uses
DBSCAN with a default cosine-distance threshold of `0.28`. If scikit-learn is
not available, it falls back to a simple centroid grouping strategy and shows
the algorithm used.

Album cluster IDs avoid duplicating existing People Library IDs. When a cluster
matches an existing person within the configured duplicate distance threshold
(`0.28` by default), the existing person ID is reused; otherwise the page assigns
the next available album person ID. The cluster thumbnail is chosen from the
face nearest the cluster centroid. Selecting a cluster shows all original photo
thumbnails for that cluster, and double-clicking a thumbnail opens the original
image.

Album directories and clustering results are saved in the local SQLite
database so the page can restore them on the next launch. **Clear** only clears
the selected album directories and leaves the current clustering results
visible. **Rebuild All** asks for confirmation, then reprocesses all selected
album directories from scratch and replaces the saved clustering results. If no
album directories are selected, **Rebuild All** clears the saved clustering
results.

## Enterprise Evaluation

Open **Enterprise Evaluation** to run no-code local evaluations:

- KYC / 1:1 Verification with a pairs CSV
- Access Control / 1:N Identification with gallery and probe folders

Other scenarios are represented as guided placeholders in v1.0 and can be
handled through their dedicated pages.

## Report Export

Reports are written to:

```text
~/.insightface/gui/reports
```

Markdown and HTML are always supported. PDF is generated when `reportlab` is
available. Install `insightface[pdf]` to add PDF report export.

## Face Swap

Open **Face Swap** to use the full-width Source + Target = Result workspace.
Choose the swap model in **Models > Runtime**; the page itself does not expose a
model picker. The swap model is loaded only when you click **Run Face Swap**.

Source is always an image. Target can be an image or a video, and the workflow
automatically chooses image swap or video swap from the target file type. Video
swap writes an `.mp4` result to the exports folder and shows a preview frame
when one is available.

If the model is missing, it shows:

```text
Face swap model not found. Please download and choose a swap model in Models.
```

Face swap may require separate commercial authorization depending on usage and
model license. Use only with appropriate rights and consent.

## License Notice

Code and model files may have different licenses. Research or publicly
distributed pretrained models may be restricted to non-commercial or research
usage. Commercial deployment requires appropriate model authorization.

This tool does not provide legal advice. Users are responsible for consent,
privacy, retention, and compliance with applicable biometric regulations.

## Troubleshooting

Run without automatic model loading:

```bash
insightface-gui --safe-mode
```

Safe mode is only applied to the current launch. It is intended for
troubleshooting model/provider issues and is not saved to `config.json`.

Force CPU:

```bash
insightface-gui --provider cpu
```

`CUDA` is selectable only when ONNX Runtime reports `CUDAExecutionProvider`.
If CUDA is requested on a machine without a usable CUDA provider, the GUI
falls back to Auto/CPU instead of exposing a broken GPU option.

Logs are stored in:

```text
~/.insightface/gui/logs/app.log
```
